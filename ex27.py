# Exercise 27 does not include any sort of code persay but introduces logical decision making through truth tables.
  # Note to self: Consult your Discrete Mathematic Book for more on the topic and logical operators.

# From Exercise 27: The Truth Terms
  # Python, like many languages, can have boolean 'true' or 'false' values for many things and conditionals.
    # Furthermore, 'truthy' and 'falsey' (actual terms I learned) account for the values that would equate to either true or false.
      # One such example would be that the integer 1 = true and integer 0 = false.
      
# Logical comparators (In Python, so double check it):
  # and
  # or
  # not
  # !=
  # ==
  # >=
  # >=
  # <=
  # True
  # False
