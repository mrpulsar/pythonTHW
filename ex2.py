# A Comment, this is so you can read your program later.
# Anything after the # is ignored by python

print "I could have code like this." # and the comment after is ignored

# You can also use a comment to "disable" or comment out a piece of code:
# print "This won't run."

print "This will run."

# Extra examples of how the hash tag symbol '#' works for commenting:

print "This # is located inside a string and therefore is not a comment."

# print "Since this line begins with the hash tag (#), it will not print, which is good because it would error if so.'
