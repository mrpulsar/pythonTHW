# Ex 28, Boolean Practice
#
# 1. Uses logical AND, evals True
# 2. Logical AND, evals False
# 3. Conditional equalities wrapped inside of a logical AND, evals False.
# 4. Conditional equality for a string, evals True
# 5. Logical OR testing an equality or a not condition, evals True
# 6. Evals True
# 7. Evals True, as False is True (WRONG) and 0 does not not equal 0, making that statement False.
# 8. True, the or conditional and the fact that the left hand side says "True"
# 9. Evals False, does not match for comparison of equality.
# 10. Oddly for some reason I want to say this evals False, but it evals True. (If I'm wrong I'll know why)
# 11. Evals True, does not equal the value expressed.
# 12. Evals False, it's a string not a boolean value
# 13. Evals True, as True && False == False and not False = True
# 14. Evals False as the statements are True and then ran under a not conditional
# 15. Evals False as the statement is True because 1000 = 1000, but not True is False.
# 16. Evals True
# 17. Evals True
# 18. Evals True
# 19. False because of and conditional
# 20. Evals False
